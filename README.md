# MovieX
-App is written solely in the Java Programming Language.

User Interface - Layout:
-UI contains an element (e.g.,settings menu and drawer layout) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.
-UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.
-Movie Details layout contains the title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
-Movie Details layout contains a section for displaying trailer videos and user reviews.

User Interface - Function
-When a user changes the sort criteria (most popular, highest rated, and favorites) the main view gets updated correctly.
-When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.
-When a trailer is selected, app uses an Intent to launch the trailer.
-In the movies detail screen, a user can tap a button(for example, a star) to mark it as a Favorite.

Network API Implementation
-In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.
-App requests for related videos for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/videos endpoint in a background thread and display those details when the user selects a movie.
-App requests for user reviews for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/reviews endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.

Data Persistence
-The titles and IDs of the userâ€™s favorite movies are stored in a native SQLite database and are exposed via a ContentProvider. This ContentProvider is updated whenever the user favorites or unfavorites a movie. No other persistence libraries are used.
-When the "favorites" setting option is selected, the main view displays the entire favorites collection based on movie ids stored in the ContentProvider.
